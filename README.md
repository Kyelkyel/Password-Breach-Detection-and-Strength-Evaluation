Password Breach Detection and Strength Evaluation

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **password security** with the integration of **digital forensics**. It is designed to help users check whether their passwords have been compromised in known data breaches and to evaluate the overall strength of those passwords. By combining **breach detection** and **strength evaluation** in a single tool, the project promotes better cybersecurity practices and supports forensic investigations.

🎯 Objectives

* Provide a simple interface for users to test their passwords.
* Detect if a password has appeared in public breach databases.
* Evaluate the strength of a password based on standard rules (length, symbols, case variety).
* Offer suggestions to improve weak passwords.
* Support digital forensics education and awareness.

🖥️ Features

* **Password Strength Evaluation** – Analyzes passwords based on rules like length, symbols, and mixed characters.
* **Breach Detection** – Connects to databases or APIs (e.g., HaveIBeenPwned) to check if the password has been leaked.
* **User-Friendly Interface** – Easy to use for students, schools, and small businesses.
* **Suggestions Module** – Provides tips to create stronger passwords.
* **Privacy First** – The system does not store user-entered passwords.

🏗️ System Architecture

* **Presentation Layer**: User input, feedback, and suggestions.
* **Application Layer**: Password strength evaluation, breach detection, and privacy module.
* **Data Layer**: Integration with breach-checking services.
* **Optional Forensics Module**: Report generation and log export for investigations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: React
* **Backend**: Python (Flask / AWS API)
* **Database**: SQL
* **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
